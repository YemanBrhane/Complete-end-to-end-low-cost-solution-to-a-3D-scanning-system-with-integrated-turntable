# Complete-end-to-end-low-cost-solution-to-a-3D-scanning-system-with-integrated-turntable
In this project a full 3D scanning system was designed which included a low cost turntable that works in unison with the final software. The software included a friendly GUI and it was implemented using C++ and Point cloud Library (PCL) that uses a Kinect sensor to acquire point clouds. The point clouds are then passed through a filter followed by registration and reconstruction in order to generate a 3D mesh which can be exported afterward to a 3D printer for printing.

## Libraries
- QT
- Point cloud Library (PCL)
- OpenGL
